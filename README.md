# Do it!

Do it! is a simple todo App that allows users to add new todo tasks and keep track of their completion.

## Functionality

By clicking the add todo button, a form opens where users add the name of the task they wish to add and they have the option to add a due date to them. Chekcing the box next to each task shows that the task has been completed. Users can also remove tasks by clicking on the delete button next to each task.

## Technology

This app uses ES6 modules to organize the code which helps make the code easier to manage and the code can be reused as needed. It uses uuidv4 to create unique randomly generated ids for each added task.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
